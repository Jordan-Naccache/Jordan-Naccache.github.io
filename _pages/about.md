I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at SnT Luxembourg in the APSIA group, led by Prof. Peter Y. A. Ryan. I hold a PhD from CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, where I was supervised by Prof. Dr. Antoine Joux and co-supervised by Dr. Beno√Æt Cogliati.

My research focuses on symmetric cryptography, particularly the analysis and design of symmetric-key schemes that ensure high security in both classical and quantum settings. I am dedicated to advancing cryptographic security in a post-quantum world, bridging rigorous theoretical foundations with practical applications.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
