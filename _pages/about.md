I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at SnT, the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust in Luxembourg, in the APSIA group, led by Prof. Peter Y. A. Ryan. My research focuses on symmetric cryptography, particularly the analysis and design of symmetric-key schemes that ensure high security in both classical and quantum settings.

With my current position, I am also expanding my work into post-quantum cryptography in the context of public-key cryptography, bridging rigorous theoretical foundations with practical applications to enhance cryptographic security in a post-quantum world.

I defended my PhD thesis in December 2024 at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, where I was supervised by Prof. Dr. Antoine Joux and co-supervised by Dr. Benoît Cogliati. Prior to my PhD, I completed my Master’s thesis under the supervision of Prof. Itai Dinur, where I worked on algorithmic techniques for analyzing and classifying vectorial Boolean functions.
